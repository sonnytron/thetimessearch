## This is my Project #2 for CodePath Android Camp

The purpose of this app is to take advantage of the [New York Times Search ](http://developer.nytimes.com/). The application takes advantage of search filters along with AsyncHttpRequestHandler, a RecyclerView which uses a Grid Layout.  

## Completed Stories  

As of 12:37 AM CST, all required stories have been submitted. Endless scrolling and filters work properly.

## Time required to complete

Overall, I have spent about 9.5 hours on this project. I feel that the good amount of time to commit would've been 12 to 15 hours.
